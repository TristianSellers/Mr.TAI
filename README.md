# Mr.TAI
Mr.Tai (Multi-media Real Time AI) is a personal project of mine, where Mr. Tai can take on any role and react, in character, to media!

I got this idea while in a deep gaming phase, specifically the game _Madden_, where I realized that the voice lines of the commentators were fixed, which limits immersion for those who deeply play. This is where Mr. Tai will come in! The current MVP is to have a user submit at most a minute long video, where Mr. Tai will take on the role of an announcer or commentator and react to what it sees!

I hope to develop this project overtime to showcase a new possibility in gaming that will immerse us gamers even further!
